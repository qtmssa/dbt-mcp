# dbt MCP Server
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/11137/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/11137)

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides various tools to interact with dbt. You can use this MCP server to provide AI agents with context of your project in dbt Core, dbt Fusion, and dbt Platform.

Read our documentation [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-ai/about-mcp) to learn more. [This](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/introducing-dbt-mcp-server) blog post provides more details for what is possible with the dbt MCP server.

## Experimental MCP Bundle

We publish an experimental Model Context Protocol Bundle (`dbt-mcp.mcpb`) with each release so that MCPB-aware clients can import this server without additional setup. Download the bundle from the latest release assets and follow Anthropic's [`mcpb` CLI](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) docs to install or inspect it.

## Architecture

The dbt MCP server architecture allows for your agent to connect to a variety of tools.

## Server Configuration

### Transport, Host, Port
- `MCP_TRANSPORT`: `stdio` / `sse` / `streamable-http`
- `FASTMCP_HOST`: listening host (default `127.0.0.1`)
- `FASTMCP_PORT`: listening port (default `8000`)

### API Key Authentication
- `DBT_MCP_API_KEY`: when set, requires `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for both `streamable-http` and `sse`
- when unset, authentication is disabled (useful for local development)

Example:
```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http
FASTMCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
FASTMCP_PORT=8000
DBT_MCP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Tools

- `compile`: Generates executable SQL from models/tests/analyses; useful for validating Jinja logic.
- `docs`: Generates documentation for the dbt project.
- `get_lineage_dev`: Retrieves lineage from local manifest.json with type and depth filtering.
- `get_node_details_dev`: Retrieves node details from local manifest.json (models, seeds, snapshots, sources).
- `list`: Lists resources in the dbt project by type with selector support.
- `parse`: Parses and validates project files for syntax correctness.
- `run`: Executes models to materialize them in the database.
- `show`: Executes SQL against the database and returns results.
- `test`: Runs tests to validate data and model integrity.

### Admin API
- `cancel_job_run`: Cancels a running job.
- `get_job_details`: Gets job configuration including triggers, schedule, and dbt commands.
- `get_job_run_artifact`: Downloads a specific artifact file from a job run.
- `get_job_run_details`: Gets run details including status, timing, steps, and artifacts.
- `get_job_run_error`: Gets error and/or warning details for a job run; option to include or show warnings only.
- `get_project_details`: Gets project information for a specific dbt project.
- `list_job_run_artifacts`: Lists available artifacts from a job run.
- `list_jobs`: Lists jobs in a dbt Platform account; option to filter by project or environment.

## Examples

Commonly, you will connect the dbt MCP server to an agent product like Claude or Cursor. However, if you are interested in creating your own agent, check out [the examples directory](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp/tree/main/examples) for how to get started.
