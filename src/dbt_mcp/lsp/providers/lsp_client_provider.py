"""LSP Client Provider Protocols for dbt Fusion LSP.

This module defines the protocols for LSP client management using dependency injection.

Protocol Naming Convention:
- LSPClientProtocol: Defines the interface for LSPClient objects (the actual client)
- LSPClientProvider: Defines the interface for provider objects that create LSPClient instances

This separation allows for:
1. Testing by mocking either the client or the provider
2. Different provider implementations (local, remote, pooled, etc.)
3. Lazy initialization of expensive LSP connections
