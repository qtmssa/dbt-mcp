"""Local LSP Client Provider Implementation.

This module provides the concrete implementation of LSPClientProvider for
local LSP connections (as opposed to remote or pooled connections).

Design:
- Each call to get_client() creates a NEW LSPClient instance
- However, all clients share the SAME underlying connection (via the connection provider)
- This allows multiple concurrent operations while maintaining a single LSP server process
- The connection is lazily initialized when first needed
